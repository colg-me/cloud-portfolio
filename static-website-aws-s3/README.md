### 01 â€“ Static Website on Amazon S3  

A simple static website hosted on **Amazon S3**, configured with proper IAM permissions and bucket policies.  
The project demonstrates how to leverage S3 for reliable and cost-effective static hosting.  

> Extension: for a production-level application (e.g., an e-commerce platform), I would integrate **Elastic Load Balancer** and **Auto Scaling Groups** to ensure high availability and elasticity.
